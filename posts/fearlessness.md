> “I didn’t expect you get this done; you don’t know how to program after all.”

After I had compiled and exported my school’s student magazine from a collection of Latex files to a printable PDF.

> “It’s just markup.”

After I had made my first web site and figured out how to `scp` it onto a friend’s web space at university. (The engineering students got all the cool stuff in the mid-90s.)

> “Installing SuSE Linux from a box isn’t anything special really, Gentoo is the real deal.”

After countless hours of fighting with Yast and a plethora of configuration files when I finally had KDE 2 running.

> “You should definitely know how to program in C to really understand a Linux system.”

From the foreword of a book that I saved up for to learn more about Linux system administration.

> “Yeah, cool, you compiled that application yourself. But have you ever patched your kernel?”

After an endless fall down the rabbit hole of chasing down obscure libraries, one compiler error at a time.

> “Ruby? That’s just scripting.”
